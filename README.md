# Quantum Computing Tutorials

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Tutorials repository! This project aims to provide comprehensive educational materials, examples, and tools for learning and developing quantum algorithms using Qiskit.

## Getting Started

To get started with quantum computing and this repository, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. **Install Qiskit:**

    Qiskit is the main quantum computing framework used in this repository. Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dkrizhanovskyi/quantum-computing-tutorials.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Tutorials Directory:**

    Navigate to the `tutorials` directory to start exploring the Jupyter notebooks:

    ```bash
    cd quantum-computing-tutorials/tutorials
    ```

### Running the Tutorials

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need Jupyter installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then, start the Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open your browser and navigate to the `tutorials` directory to start exploring the notebooks.
