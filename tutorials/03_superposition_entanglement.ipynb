          "Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state that is a combination of both. This property allows quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously."

When qubits are entangled, the measurement of one qubit instantaneously determines the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are."
