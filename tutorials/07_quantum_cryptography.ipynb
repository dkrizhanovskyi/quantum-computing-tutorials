        "4. Alice and Bob compare their bases over a classical channel.\n",
        "5. If their bases match, they use the corresponding bits to form a key."

The security of these protocols is based on the fundamental properties of entanglement, making it impossible for an eavesdropper to intercept the key without disturbing the entangled states."
